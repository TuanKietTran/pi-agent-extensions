# Pi TUI layout

This directory owns local modifications to Pi's built-in terminal layout.

## Right-side metadata

`install-layout.mjs` makes the right panel the standard home for persistent TUI metadata. It preserves Pi's public `ctx.ui` mounting API and assigns its positions consistently:

1. **Topmost:** Pi's **Tools**, **Running**, and **Pending chats** block.
2. **Middle:** extension widgets mounted with `ctx.ui.setWidget(..., { placement: "aboveEditor" })`. This region receives the flexible height.
3. **Bottommost:** widgets mounted with `placement: "belowEditor"`, followed by extension statuses and Pi's footer.

The editor remains in the main chat column. Extensions should use `setWidget` and `setStatus` rather than reaching into Pi's viewport internals; the layout patch decides where those standard mounts render.

## Responsive and collapsible panel

The panel automatically selects a width from the terminal width:

| Terminal columns | Panel columns |
|---:|---:|
| 150+ | 52 |
| 120–149 | 44 |
| 92–119 | 36 |
| 72–91 | 28 |
| below 72 | hidden |

Use the bundled command to override visibility for the current Pi process:

```text
/right-panel              # toggle
/right-panel hide
/right-panel show          # responsive sizing resumes
/right-panel status
```

Pi does not currently expose the fullscreen viewport layout through the extension API, so the column reassignment itself cannot be implemented as a normal `ctx.ui` extension. The installer applies a narrow, idempotent patch to both Pi's readable distribution module and the executable bundle. It fails rather than guessing if an upgrade changes the relevant layout.

Run after installing or upgrading Pi:

```sh
cd ~/Downloads/pi-agent-extensions
npm run install:tui
```

Restart Pi afterward. To target a nonstandard installation:

```sh
PI_PACKAGE_DIR=/path/to/@earendil-works/pi-coding-agent npm run install:tui
```
